I started reading [this blog post](http://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-classes-in-depth) 
and decided to use some of the simple classes found there as the basis for
testing es6 class and module functionality within node v4.1.0.

I was surprised that import/export didn't work, instead we must continue to use
require/module.exports (commonJS) syntax.

To run the code in this repo: `node main`
